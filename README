HTML5 Tic-Tac-Toe game done in ear1y 2012. Included below is my analysis of the project.

Analysis - 2/17/12
Having had no prior experience with HTML5, much less the canvas, I decided to jump right into this project while
challenging myself to a new practice. Because I believe that HTML5 is a viable option for the future of website and
browser based internet, I decided that now was a good time to start.
The canvas was really quite easy to learn and all of my HTML and CSS coding went amazingly well.
Since the HTML5 canvas works similar to divisions, I did not need to create CSS styles for the nine divisions of
Tic-Tac-Toe squares. This cut down on the number of lines of CSS utilized.
The JavaScript overall ended up well, but was the most difficult. I found that the functions were fairly easy to
distinguish, but difficult to write. The only error that is causing the program to run incorrectly is that in line
36. form(); only accepts inputs for xWins.
